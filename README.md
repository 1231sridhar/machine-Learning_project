Introduction: This study utilizes the Support Vector Machine (SVM) to analyze the renowned Iris dataset, introduced by Ronald Fisher in 1936. The dataset is a staple in pattern recognition and machine learning, containing 150 samples from three iris species: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica. Each sample includes measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The goal is to develop an SVM model that can accurately predict the iris species using these measurements. SVMs are adept at classification by creating hyperplanes that separate classes with the largest margin possible. Training an SVM with the Iris dataset will help reveal patterns that differentiate the species, allowing for the accurate classification of new iris samples.
Code Approach:
2.1) Library Imports: We use pandas for data handling and analysis, matplotlib.pyplot for visualizations, and sklearn’s datasets for accessing standard machine learning datasets. The sklearn.model_selection provides tools like train_test_split and KFold for data splitting and cross-validation. sklearn.preprocessing’s StandardScaler normalizes features, and sklearn.svm’s SVC is used for classification tasks. Performance metrics such as accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score, and f1_score from sklearn.metrics assess the model’s accuracy.

2.2) Dataset Loading: The Iris dataset, a well-known benchmark in machine learning, consists of 150 iris flower samples, each with four attributes and a target variable indicating the species.

2.3) Data Preprocessing: We separate the features (X) and the target (y) for processing and use pandas to organize the data into a DataFrame (iris_df) for easier analysis and visualization.

2.4) Data Exploration: The describe() function provides dataset summary statistics. Scatter plots and histograms help visualize feature relationships and data distribution among classes.

2.5) Data Scaling: StandardScaler is applied to normalize the features, which is crucial for distance-based machine learning algorithms.

2.6) Train-Test Split: We split the data into training and testing sets to evaluate the model’s performance on new data and prevent overfitting.

2.7) Model Training: A ‘sigmoid’ kernel SVM classifier is trained on the scaled data. Kernel choice is vital for SVM performance.

2.8) K-Fold Cross-Validation: This method assesses the model’s robustness by dividing the dataset into ‘k’ parts, training the model ‘k’ times, each with a different validation fold.

2.9) Performance Evaluation: The model’s effectiveness is gauged on the test set using various metrics.
